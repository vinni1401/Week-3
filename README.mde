## 📝 Overview

In Week 3, we explore some of the most important data structures and algorithmic techniques used in computer science and programming. By the end of this week, you'll be able to implement and apply:

- **Linked Lists**, **Stacks**, and **Queues**
- **Hashing techniques** for fast lookups
- Common **Sorting algorithms**
- **Searching techniques** including Binary Search

These skills are foundational for solving real-world problems and performing well in coding interviews.
